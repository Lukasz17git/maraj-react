# Maraj-React

A tiny library for adding granular, performant, extremelly flexible and type-safe forms in React.
A tiny wrapper to support component stores and SSR stores on top of Zustand.

Has 3 dependencies + React:

- Maraj (immutable updates).
- Zustand (state-management).
- React-fast-compare (deep object comparison, to be able to send only changed fields in form-mutations).
